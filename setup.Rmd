title: 'Setup Instructions'

Please follow the instructions under **_Get the Data_** and **_Core Software_** headings below. Depending on the class you're taking, you may also need to follow additional setup instructions under the [**_Electives_**](#electives) heading.


## Get the Data

Click the **[<i class="fa fa-download"></i> Data](data.html)** link on the navbar at the top. You can download all the data needed by downloading **[this zip file <i class="fa fa-file-archive-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>](data.zip)** or by downloading individual data sets as needed at the **[<i class="fa fa-download"></i> Data](data.html)** page.


## Core Software

Install the following software.

### R

**Install R.** You'll need R version **3.6.0** or higher. Download and install R for [Windows](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) or [Mac](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) (download the latest R-3.x.x.pkg file for your appropriate version of Mac OS).

### RStudio

Download and install **[RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)** version = 1.2.5019.

R and RStudio are separate downloads and installations. **R** is the underlying statistical computing environment, but using R alone is no fun. **RStudio** is a graphical integrated development environment that makes using R much easier. You need R installed before you install RStudio.

### CRAN packages

We will need to install several core packages needed for most lessons. Launch RStudio (RStudio, *not R itself*). Ensure that you have internet access, then copy and paste the following commands, one-at-a-time, into the **Console** panel (usually the lower-left panel, by default) and hit the Enter/Return key. If you receive an error message when trying to install any particular package, please make note of which one you had trouble with, and [email one of the instructors](people.html) _prior to class_ with the command you typed and the error you received.


_A few notes_:

- Commands are case-sensitive. 
- You must be connected to the internet.
- Even if you've installed these packages in the past, do re-install the most recent version. Many of these packages are updated often, and we may use new features in the workshop that aren't available in older versions.
- If you're using Windows you might see errors about not having permission to modify the existing libraries -- disregard these. You can avoid this by running RStudio as an administrator (right click the RStudio icon, then click "Run as Administrator").


These commands may produce some notes or other output, but as long as they work without an error message, you're good to go. If you get a message that says something like: `Error in library(packageName) : there is no package called 'packageName'`, then the required packages did not install correctly. Please do not hesitate to [email one of the instructors](people.html) _prior to the course_ if you are still having difficulty.
