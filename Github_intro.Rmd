This short(ish) tutorial will introduce you to using a version control system to keep track of all your important PhD documents and facilitate collaboration with colleagues. The tutorial will focus on using the software 'Git' in combination with the web-based hosting service 'GitHub'. By the end of the tutorial, you will be able to install and configure Git and GitHub on your computer, setup and work with a version controlled project in RStudio, track changes in your project, revert to previous versions of your project and finally how to resolve issues with Git and GitHub. Just a note of caution, version control and Git is a very large (and sometimes complicated) subject area which will take you some time to get completely comfortable with. This tutorial will get you started with the basics but be prepared to do some extra [reading](#resources) and don't worry if it takes you some time to get your head around it all. It's worth it!

I estimate that this tutorial should take you roughly 1.5 to 2.5 hours to complete in one sitting, but feel free to dip in and out over a longer period if that suits you better.  

\  

## What is version control?

\  

A [Version Control System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) (VCS)  keeps a record of all the changes you make to your files that make up a particular project and allows you to revert to previous versions of files if you need to. In other words, if you muck things up or accidently lose important files you can easily roll back to a previous stage in your project to sort things out. Version control was originally designed for collaborative software development, but it's equally useful for scientific research and collaborations (although admitidately a lot of the terms, jargon and functionality are focussed on the software development side). There are many different version control systems currently available, but we will focus on using *Git*, because it's free and open source and it integrates nicely with RStudio. This means that its can easily become part of your usual workflow with minimal additional overhead.  

\  

## Why use version control?

\  

So why should you worry about version control? Well, first of all it helps avoid this (familiar?) situation when you're working on a project

\  

```{r youNeedVC1, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="You need version control"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/Messy_folder.PNG")
```

\  

usually arising from this (familiar?) scenario

\  

```{r youNeedVC2, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/final_doc.gif")
```

\  

Version control automatically takes care of keeping a record of all the versions of a particular file and allows you to revert back to previous versions if you need to. Version control also helps you (especially the future you) keep track of all your files and it helps others (especially collaborators) review, contribute to and reuse your work through the GitHub website. Lastly, your files are always available from anywhere (and on any computer), all you need is an internet connection.

\  

## What is Git and GitHub?

\  

**Git** is a version control system originally developed by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) that lets you track changes to a set of files. These files can be any type of file including the menagerie of files that typically make up a data orientated project (.pdf, .Rmd, .docx, .txt, .jpg etc) but plain text files work the best. All the files that make up a project is called a Git **repository** (or just **repo**).

**GitHub** is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories, which allows you to create a remote copy of your local version-controlled project. This creates a backup and archive of your project, making it accessible to you and to your collaborators. 

At the start of a project we typically create a **remote** repository on GitHub, then **clone** (think of this as copying) this repository to our **local** computer (the one in front of you). This cloning is usually a one time event and you shouldn't need to clone this repository again unless you muck things up later. Once you have cloned your repository you can then work on your project as usual creating and saving files for your data analysis (scripts, R markdown documents, figures etc). Along the way you can take snapshots of these files after you've made important changes. We can then **push** these changes to the **remote** GitHub repository to make a backup or make available to our collaborators. If other people are working on the same project (**repository**), or maybe your working on a different computer, you can **pull** these changes back to your local repository so everything is synchronised.

\  

## Getting started {#setup_git}

\  

This tutorial assumes that you have already installed the latest versions of R and RStudio. If you haven't done this yet you can find instructions [here](setup.html).

\  

### Install Git

\  

To get started, we first need to install Git. If you're lucky you may already have Git installed (especially if you have a Mac or Linux computer). You can check if you already have Git installed by clicking on the Terminal tab in the Console window in RStudio and typing `git --version` (the space after `git` is important). If you see something that looks like `git version 2.25.0` (the version number may be different on your computer) then you already have git installed (happy days). If you get an error (something like `git: command not found`) this means you don't have git installed (yet!).


\  

```{r git-version, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/git_version.png")
```

\  

You can also do the above outside RStudio by opening up a separate Terminal if you want. On Windows go to the 'Start menu' and in the search bar (or run line) type `cmd` and press enter. On a Mac go to 'Applications' in Finder, click on the 'Utilities' folder and then on the 'Terminal' program. On a Linux machine simply open the Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T often does it). 

\  

To install Git on a **windows** computer we recommend you download and install Git for windows (also known as 'Git Bash'). You can find the download file and installation instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). 

For those of you using a **Mac** computer we recommend you download Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install in the usual way (double click on the installer package once downloaded). If you've previously installed Xcode on your Mac and want to use a more up to date version of Git then you will need to follow a few more steps documented [here](https://github.com/timcharper/git_osx_installer). If you've never heard of Xcode then don't worry about it!

For those of you lucky enough to be working on a **Linux** machine you can simply use your OS package manager to install Git from the official repository. For Ubuntu Linux (or variants of) open your Terminal and type

\  

```markup
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

\  

You will need adminstrative privilages to do this. For other versions of Linux see [here](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) for further installation instructions.  

Whatever version of Git you are installing, once the installation has finished verify that the installtion process has been successful by running the command `git --version` in the Terminal tab in the Console in RStudio (as descibed above). 

\  

### Configure Git

\  

After installing Git, you need to configure it so you can use it. Click on the Terminal tab in the Console window again and type the following:

\  

```
git config --global user.email 'you@youremail.com'

git config --global user.name 'Your Name'
```

\  

substituting `'Your Name'` for your actual name and `'you@youremail.com'` with your email address. We recommend you use your University email address as you will also use this address when you register for your GitHub account (comming up in a bit).  

If this was successful, you should see no error messages from these commands. To verify that you have successfully configured Git type the following into the Terminal

\  

```
git config --global --list
```

\  

You should see both your `user.name` and `user.email` configured. 

As you can see above, Git can be used from the command line, but it also integrates well with RStudio, providing a friendly graphical user interface. If you want to use RStudio's Git integration, you need to check that the path to the Git executable is specified correctly. In RStudio, go to the menu `Tools` -> `Global Options` -> `Git/SVN` and make sure that 'Enable version control interface for RStudio projects' is ticked and that the 'Git executable:' path is correct for your installation. If it's not correct hit the `Browse...` button and navigate to where you installed git and click on the executable file. You will need to restart RStudio after doing this.

\  

```{r git-rs, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/git_path.png")
```

\  

### Register a GitHub account

\  

If all you need to do is to keep track of files and file versions on your local computer then Git is sufficient. If however, you would like to make an off-site copy of your project or make it available to your collaborators then you will need a web-based hosting service for your Git repositories. This is where GitHub comes into play (there are also other services like [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product) and [Savannah](https://savannah.gnu.org/)). You can sign up for a free account on GitHub [here](https://github.com/join?source=header-home). You will need to specify a username, an email address and a strong password. We suggest that you use your University email address as this will also allow you to apply for a free [educator or researcher account](https://help.github.com/en/github/teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/applying-for-an-educator-or-researcher-discount) later on which gives you some useful [benefits](https://help.github.com/en/github/teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/about-github-education-for-educators-and-researchers) (don't worry about this now though). When it comes to choosing a username we suggest you give this some thought. Choose a short(ish) rather than a long username, use all lowercase and hyphenate if you want to include multiple words, find a way of incorporating your actual name and lastly, choose a username that you will feel comfortable revealing to your future employer!  

Next click on the 'Select a plan' (you may have to solve a simple puzzle first to verify you're human) and choose the 'Free Plan' option. Github will send an email to the email address you supplied for you to verify.  

Once you've completed all those steps you should have both Git and GitHub setup up ready for you to use (Finally!).

\  

## Setting up a project in RStudio

\  

Now that you're all set up, let's create your first version controlled RStudio project. There are a couple of different approaches you can use to do this. You can either setup a remote GitHub repository first then connect an RStudio project to this (we'll call this Option 1). Another option is to setup a local repository first and then link a remote GitHub repository to this (Option 2). You can also connect an existing project to a GitHub repository but we won't cover this here. I would suggest that if you are completely new to Git and GitHub then use Option 1 as this approach sets up your local Git repository nicely and you can **push** and **pull** immediately. Option 2 requires more work (and therefore there are more opportunities to go wrong). 

\  

### Option 1 - GitHub first

\  

To use the GitHub first approach you will first need to create a **repository (repo)** on GitHub. Go to your [GitHub page](https://github.com/) and sign in if necessary. Click on the 'Repositories' tab at the top and on the green 'New' button on the right 

\  

```{r new-repo1, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/new_repo.png")
```

\  

Give your new repo a name (let's call it `first_repo` for this tutorial), select 'Public', tick on the 'Initialize this repository with a README' (this is important) and then click on 'Create repository' (ignore the other options for now). 

\  

```{r new-repo2, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/new_repo_opt.png")
```

\  

Your new GitHub repository will now be created. Notice the README has been rendered in GitHub and is in markdown (.md) format (see the other [tutorial on R markdown](Rmarkdown_intro.html) if this doesn't mean anything to you). Next click on the green 'Clone or Download' button and copy the `https//...` URL that pops up to the clipboard (highlight it all and copy or click on the clipboard icon to the right).

\  

```{r new-repo3, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/new_repo_clone.png")
```

\  

Ok, now we switch our attention to RStudio. In RStudio click on the `File` -> `New Project` menu. In the pop up window select `Version Control`.

\  

```{r new-proj1, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/proj_setup1.png")
```

\  

Now paste the the URL you previously copied from GitHub into the `Repository URL:` box. This should then automatically fill out the `Project Directory Name:` section with the correct repository name (it's important that the name of this directory has the same name as the repository you created in GitHub). You can then select where you want this directory created by clicking on the 'Browse' button opposite the `Create project as a subdirectory of:` option. Navigate to where you want the directopry created and click OK. I also tick the `Open in new session` option. 

\  

```{r new-proj2, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/proj_setup2.png")
```

\  

RStudio will now **clone** your remote repository to your local computer and will create a new directory with the same name as your repository. This directory will contain three new files; `first_repo.Rproj` (or whatever you called your repository), `README.md` and `.gitignore`. You can check this out in the `Files` tab usually in the bottom right pane in RStudio. You will also have a `Git` tab in the top right pane with the three files listed (we will come to this later on in the tutorial). That's it for Option 1, you now have a remote GitHub repository set up and this is linked to your local repository managed by RStudio. Any changes you make to files in this directory will be version controlled by Git.

\  

### Option 2 - RStudio first

\  

An alternative approach is to create a local RStudio project first and then create and link to a remote Github repository. As I mentioned above, this option is more involved than Option 1 so feel free to skip this now and come back later to it if you're interested. However, this option is useful if you just want to create a local Git repository and not link it to GitHub.

\  

In RStudio click on the `File` -> `New Project` menu and select the `New Directory` option.

\  

```{r new-proj3, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/new_proj_RS1.png")
```

\  

In the pop up window select `New Project` option

\  

```{r new-proj4, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/proj_setup_RS.png")
```

\ 

In the New Project window specify a `Directory name` (choose `second_repo` for this tutorial) and select where you would like to create this subdirectory on you computer (click the Browse button). Make sure the `Create a git repository` option is ticked 

\  

```{r new-proj5, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/new_proj_RS2.png")
```

\  

This will create a version controlled directory called `second_repo` on your computer that contains two files, `second_repo.Rproj` and `.gitignore` (there might also be a `.Rhistory` file but ignore this). You can check this by looking in the 'Files' tab in RStudio (usually in the bottom right pane).  

\  

```{r new-proj6, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/new_proj_RS3.png")
```

\  

OK, before we go on to create a repository on GitHub we need to do one more thing - we need to place our `second_repo.Rproj` and `.gitignore`files under version control. Unfortunately we haven't covered this in detail yet so just follow the next few instructions (blindly!) and we'll revisit them in the [Using Git](#use_git) section of this tutorial.  

To get our two files under version control click on the 'Git' tab which is usually in the top tight pane in RStudio

\  

```{r new-proj7, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/new_proj_RS4.png")
```

\  

You can see that both files are listed. Next, tick the boxes under the 'Staged' column for both files and then click on the 'Commit' button. 

\  

```{r new-proj8, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/new_proj_RS5.png")
```

\  

This will take you to the Commit window. Type in the commit message 'First commit' in the 'Commit message' window and click on the 'Commit' button. A new window will appear with some messages which you can ignore for now. Click 'Close' to close this window and also close the Commit window. The two files should now have disappeared from the Git pane in RStudio indicating a successful commit. 

\  

```{r new-proj9, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/new_proj_RS6.png")
```

\  

OK, that's those two files now under version control. Now we need to create a new repository on GitHub. In your browser go to your [GitHub page](https://github.com/) and sign in if necessary. Click on the green 'New' button on the right. Give your new repo the name `second_repo` (the same as your version controlled directory name) and select 'Public'. This time **do not** tick the 'Initialize this repository with a README' (this is important) and then click on 'Create repository'. 

\  


```{r new-proj10, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/new_proj_RS7.png")
```

\  

This will take you to a Quick setup page which provides you with some code for various situations. The code we are interested in is the code under `...or push an existing repository from the command line` heading.  

\  

```{r new-proj11, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/new_proj_RS8.png")
```

\  

Highlight and copy the first line of code (note: yours will be slightly different as it will include your GitHub username not mine)  

`git remote add origin https://github.com/alexd106/second_repo.git`  

Switch to RStudio, click on the 'Terminal' tab and paste the command into the Terminal. Now go back to GitHub and copy the second line of code  

`git push -u origin master`  

and paste this into the Terminal in RStudio. You should see something like this

\  

```{r new-proj12, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/new_prog_RS9.png")
```

\  

If you take a look at your repo back on GitHub (click on the `/second_repo` link at the top) you will see the `second_repo.Rproj` and `.gitignore` files have now been **pushed** to GitHub.

\  

```{r new-proj13, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/new_proj_RS10.png")
```

\  

The last thing we need to do is create and add a **README** file to your repository. A README file describes your project and all the files that are in the repo. A good README file makes it easy for others (or the future you!) to use your code and reproduce your project. You can create a README file from RStudio or in GitHub. Let's use the second option.  

In your repository on GitHub click on the green `Add a README` button. 

\  

```{r new-proj14, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/new_proj_RS11.png")
```

\  

Now write a short description of your project in the `<> Edit new file` section and then click on the green `Commit new file` button. 

\  

```{r new-proj15, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/new_proj_RS12.png")
```

\  

You should now see the `README.md` file listed in your repository. It won't actually exist on your computer yet as you will need to **pull** these changes back to your local repository, but more about that in the next section.  

\  

Whether you followed Option 1 or Option 2 (or both) you have now successfully setup a version controlled directory (and project) in RStudio and linked this to a GitHub repository. Git will now monitor this directory for any changes you make (adding new files, deleting unused files etc) and also any changes you make to files contained within the directory. If the steps above seem like a bit of an ordeal, just remember, you only need to do this once for each project and it gets much easier over time. 

\  

## Using Git {#use_git}

\  

Now that we have our project and repositories (both local and remote) set up, it's finally time to learn how to use Git in RStudio!  

Typically, when using Git your workflow will go something like this:  

\  

1. You create/delete and edit files in your project directory on your computer as usual (saving these changes as you go)  

2. Once you've reached a natural 'break point' in your progress (i.e. you'd be sad if you lost this progress) you **stage** these files

3. You then **commit** these changes (along with a useful commit message) which creates a permanent snapshot of these changes  

4. You keep on with this cycle until you get to a point when you would like to **push** these changes to GitHub  

5. If you're working with other people on the same project you may also need to **pull** their changes to your local computer  

```{r workflow, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/workflow_3.png")
```

\  

OK, lets go through an example to help clarify this workfow. In RStudio open up the `first_repo.Rproj` file you created previously during Option 1. Let's create an R markdown document inside this project by clicking on the `File` -> `New File` -> `R markdown` menu (remember from the [R markdown tutorial](Rmarkdown_intro.html)?).  

Once created, we can delete all the example R markdown code (except the YAML header) as usual and write some interesting R markdown text and include a plot. We'll use the inbuilt `cars` dataset to do this. Save this file (cmd + s for Mac or ctrl + s in Windows). Your R markdown document should look something like the following (it doesn't matter if it's not exactly the same).

\  

```{r rm1, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/first_Rmd.png")
```

\  

Take a look at the `Git` tab which should list your new R markdown document (`first_doc.Rmd` in this example) along with `first_repo.Rproj`, `README.md` and `.gitignore` (you created these files when following Option 1).

\  

```{r rm2, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/first_Rmd2.png")
```

***
Work in progress below

\  

Once your project is set up, you can start working on your code, perhaps by creating an R script that reads in your data and carries out some preliminary analysis. First open a new R script, then type some commands, for example:

```{r cars_plot}

data(cars)

plot(cars)

```

Now you can save your script. RStudio will automatically save your script in your project directory, so just give it a name and click **Save**.

After you've created this file in your project, you need to get it under version control. By default, the git version control pane is in the top right hand corner of RStudio. Find it and click on the **Git** tab. You'll see a list of the files in your project directory.

\  

```{r gitTab, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="The git tab"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/GitTab.png")
```

\  


If you hover the mouse pointer over the yellow *?* marks in RStudio, you'll see a tooltip telling you that the files are *Untracked*. This means that git is not tracking versions of these files.

Git will only keep track of modifications to files that it has been asked to manage, so you need to tell git which files to track.

Tick the **Staged** checkbox for each file. 

All of your files are now staged, ready for you to record those changes as a *commit*. Each commit creates a snapshot of the project directory, allowing you to record the state of your project through time. Click on **Commit**.

This will open a pane showing details of the commit. You need to specify a **Commit message** in the right hand panel. Commit messages should explain *why you have made a change* and not *what* you have changed. Git keeps track of *what* has changed (see use of **Diff** below) and so it is best not to use commit messages for this purpose. The commit message lets your future self or your collaborators know *why* you made this change.

Since this is the first commit, you can follow tradition and use a brief message such as *First commit*, but for subsequent commits it's worth providing a more descriptive message. Once you've typed a commit message, click on **Commit**.


\  

```{r firstCommit, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Your first commit"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/FirstCommit.png")
```

\  

A message displaying the output from git will be shown. Click on **Close** and you are done.

\ 

### Making changes 

Now we want to make some changes to our R script, for example modify a plot.

```{r change_plot}
plot(cars, col="red")
```

After you have modified your code, save the script. Now, click on the **Git** tab in RStudio. You'll notice that there's only one file listed, since RStudio only lists files that have changed in its git interface.

Click on the **Staged** checkbox to stage your change. Now click on **Diff** (next to **Commit**) to display a summary of what's changed. Lines that have been added are green. Lines that have been removed are red (note that from git's point of view, a modification to a line is actually two operations: the removal of the original line followed by the creation of a new line).

\  

```{r diff, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Review your changes"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/Diff.png")
```

\  

Add a commit message and click on **Commit**.
In the **Git** tab of RStudio, click on **Diff** and then **History**. You'll see that you can look through every commit you've ever made. This can be extremely useful for finding bugs or looking back to how your model looked a few months ago.

\  



\  


### Pulling and pushing changes {#pull_push}

Once a local repository has been associated with GitHub, it's not necessary to use the command line for subsequent uploads. However, you will want to always keep the local (e.g., your personal computer) and remote (e.g., GitHub) copy in sync with one another. To do this you will **Pull** and **Push** changes from one copy to the other.

When you start working on your local repository (e.g., files on your own computer), it is best to start by **Pulling** any new changes off of your remote repository (e.g., GitHub). Similarly, when you are finished working on them in your local repository (e.g., your computer) it is good to then **Push** them to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub). We will walk through this basic workflow that enables you to keep your local files in sync across multiple computers or when files may change because of someone else working on the project.

To start working on a project, **Pull** any new changes to update your local copy.

\  

```{r pullChanges, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Pull changes from remote repository"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/PullMaster.png")
```

\  

Now make a change to your script, commit the change and **Push**. You should see something like this:

\  

```{r pushChanges, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Push changes to remote repository"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/PushMsg.png")
```

\  

And you're done! Now your remote and local copy are synchronised and any changes you've made are available to you and your collaborators.

\  

## A version control workflow {#vc_workflow}

Let's summarise the steps you can take to version control your project.

1. Set up a local version control repository (section [8.2](#rstudio_git))

2. Write some code

3. Save your script to the local repository

4. Choose (*stage*) files to be included in the version history

5. Commit your files

## Using git from the command line {#command_line}

You don't need to use RStudio to be able to version control your R projects. You can use git from the command line. In this section we will go through the same steps explained in the previous sections but using git commands.

\  

### Setting up a git repository

Open a Terminal (or command prompt if on Windows) as you have done in section [8.1](#setup_git). To set up a local git repository, enter the following commands:

```{}
mkdir myproj
cd myproj
git init
```

The first command creates a new directory called *myproj*, the second changes the working directory to your new folder and the last line initiates the git repository. Although you won't see any changes in your directory *myproj*, the command `git init` has created the hidden structure that git needs to start tracking changes in your files.

\  

### Staging files and first commit

In RStudio we told git which files we wanted to keep track of by ticking the checkbox next to the file name. We can give git the same instruction from the command line. Create a new R script in your new directory *myproj*. You can just copy the code from the previous Script.R file. Once you have saved your script enter the following command:

```{}
git add Script.R
```

And your file is now under version control.The command `git status` will produce a summary of the current state of the working directory, listing files that have changes that need to be committed, those that have not been staged and files that are not being tracked.

Now that your script is being tracked, you can create your first commit with the following command:

```{}
git commit -m "My first commit"

```

The `-m` option allows you to specify a commit message directly.
Before we go any further, check that version control is set by running `git log`. This will report the details of your first commit.

Now that your project is under version control, you can start making changes to your code.At every point while you are working on your project, you can use `git status` to check which files have been modified and `git diff` for more details on the changes you've made. Once you are happy with your changes use `git add` to stage your file and `git commit` to commit them. The command `git commit` without the option `-m` will open a text editor that you can use to write a longer commit message.

\  

### Connecting to a remote repository

As we did in section [8.3](#github), you can create a remote repository on GitHub and connect your local repository.
 Follow the steps in section [8.3.1](#github) to create a new repository on GitHub. After you click on the green **Create repository** button, copy and paste the commands found under the section labelled **...or push an existing repository from the command line** into the command line. 

\  

### The workflow

Once your remote repository is set up, you can use the same workflow explained in section [8.4](#vc_workflow).

1. Make changes to your files or add new files
2. Stage the new or modified files with the command `git add`
3. Commit the changes you have made with `git commit`
4. Push your changes to the remote repository with `git push`

Now that you have a version control workflow, there are different things you can do.

\  

#### View your project history 

Your commits are a record of all the changes you have made to your code; viewing this history can help you track the development of your project, highlight major revisions and identify where a bug was introduced.

\  

#### Revert to a previous commit 

Oops, I broke it! One of the great things about a version control system is that if you break your code you can always go back to when it was still working. There are two ways:

1. If you have made a mistake or you forgot to include a file in your last commit, which you have not yet pushed to your remote repository, then you can just make your changes, use `git add` to stage the new or the changed file and then use the command `git commit --amend`. This will change your previous commit to include the new changes. You can also use this command on its own if you just want to modify the commit message.

2. If you are already a few commits away from the one that broke your code and you need to go back to a previous version of your project, first use `git reflog`, which will show you a list of everything you have done in git. Then, find the step that broke your code. Finally use `git reset` and the step's index (something of the form `HEAD@{index}`, which you'll find in the output of `git reflog`) to revert to that point in time. Seems like magic, but it has limitations. `git reset` can create problems if you have already pushed changes to the remote repository, so only use it in this way if you want to go back a series of commits that you have not pushed yet.

\  

#### Collaborate 

GitHub is a great tool for collaboration, it can seem scary and complicated at first, but it is worth investing some time to learn how it works. What makes it so good for collaboration is that it is a *distributed system*, which means that every collaborator works on their own copy of the project and changes are then merged together in the remote repository. There are two different ways you can set up a collaborative project on GitHub. One is the workflow we just went through, where everybody connects their local repository to the same remote one; this system works well with small project where different people mainly work on different aspects of the project. The second approach consists of every collaborator creating a copy (or *fork*) of the main repository, which becomes their remote repository. Every collaborator then needs to send a request (a *pull request*) to the owner of the main repository to incorporate any changes into the main repository and this includes a review process before the changes are integrated.

Git offers a number of advanced features that you can incorporate in your workflow. If you are going to be working on a large collaborative project it is worth looking into *forking*, *branching* and *pull requests*. If you are the only person working on your code, then the workflow detailed here is usually enough.

## Further resources {#resources}

There are many good guides online to learn more about git and GitHub and as with any open source software there is a huge community that can be a great resource:

- The British Ecological Society guide to [Reproducible Code](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BES-Guide-Reproducible-Code-2019.pdf)

- The [GitHub guides](https://guides.github.com/)

- The Mozilla Science Lab [GitHub for Collaboration on Open Projects guide](https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/github_for_collaboration/)

- If you have done something terribly wrong and don't know how to fix it try [Oh Shit, Git](https://ohshitgit.com/)

These are only a couple of examples, all you need to do is Google "version control with git and GitHub" to see how huge the community around these open source projects is and how many free resources are available for you to become a version control expert.
