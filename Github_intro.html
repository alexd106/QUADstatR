<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Version control with Git and GitHub</h1>

</div>


<p> </p>
<p>This short(ish!) tutorial will introduce you to the basics of using a version control system to keep track of all your important PhD documents and facilitate collaboration with colleagues. The tutorial will focus on using the software ‘Git’ in combination with the web-based hosting service ‘GitHub’. By the end of the tutorial, you will be able to install and configure Git and GitHub on your computer, setup and work with a version controlled project in RStudio, track changes in your project and revert to previous versions of your project.</p>
<p>I estimate that this tutorial should take you roughly 1.5 to 2.5 hours to complete in one sitting, but feel free to dip in and out over a longer period if that suits you better.</p>
<p>Just a note of caution. In this tutorial we’ll be using RStudio to interface with Git as it gives you a nice friendly graphical user interface. However, the downside to using RStudio with Git is that RStudio only provides pretty basic Git functionality (more than enough to get you going though). If you really want to benefit from using Git’s power you will need to learn some Git commands using the command line and that is a whole different tutorial! See some of the <a href="#resources">links</a> below if you do want to dip your toes into the wonderful world of Git.</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="what-is-version-control" class="section level2">
<h2>What is version control?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">Version Control System</a> (VCS) keeps a record of all the changes you make to your files that make up a particular project and allows you to revert to previous versions of files if you need to. To put it another way, if you muck things up or accidentally lose important files you can easily roll back to a previous stage in your project to sort things out. Version control was originally designed for collaborative software development, but it’s equally useful for scientific research and collaborations (although admittedly a lot of the terms, jargon and functionality are focused on the software development side). There are many different version control systems currently available, but we will focus on using <em>Git</em>, because it’s free and open source and it integrates nicely with RStudio. This means that its can easily become part of your usual workflow with minimal additional overhead.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="why-use-version-control" class="section level2">
<h2>Why use version control?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>So why should you worry about version control? Well, first of all it helps avoid this (familiar?) situation when you’re working on a project</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/Messy_folder.PNG" alt="You need version control" width="75%" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>usually arising from this (familiar?) scenario</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/final_doc.gif" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Version control automatically takes care of keeping a record of all the versions of a particular file and allows you to revert back to previous versions if you need to. Version control also helps you (especially the future you) keep track of all your files in a single place and it helps others (especially collaborators) review, contribute to and reuse your work through the GitHub website. Lastly, your files are always available from anywhere (and on any computer), all you need is an internet connection.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-git-and-github" class="section level2">
<h2>What is Git and GitHub?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Git</strong> is a version control system originally developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> that lets you track changes to a set of files. These files can be any type of file including the menagerie of files that typically make up a data orientated project (.pdf, .Rmd, .docx, .txt, .jpg etc) although plain text files work the best. All the files that make up a project is called a <strong>repository</strong> (or just <strong>repo</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>GitHub</strong> is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories, which allows you to create a remote copy of your local version-controlled project. This creates a backup and archive of your project, making it accessible to you and to your collaborators.</p>
<p>At the start of a project we typically create a <strong>remote</strong> repository on GitHub, then <strong>clone</strong> (think of this as copying) this repository to our <strong>local</strong> computer (the one in front of you). This cloning is usually a one time event and you shouldn’t need to clone this repository again unless you muck things up later. Once you have cloned your repository you can then work on your project as usual creating and saving files for your data analysis (scripts, R markdown documents, figures etc). Along the way you can take snapshots of these files after you’ve made important changes. We can then <strong>push</strong> these changes to the remote GitHub repository to make a backup or make available to our collaborators. If other people are working on the same project (<strong>repository</strong>), or maybe you’re working on a different computer, you can <strong>pull</strong> these changes back to your local repository so everything is synchronised.</p>

</div>
<div id="setup_git" class="section level2">
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>This tutorial assumes that you have already installed the latest versions of R and RStudio. If you haven’t done this yet you can find instructions <a href="setup.html">here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="install-git" class="section level3">
<h3>Install Git</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>To get started, we first need to install Git. If you’re lucky you may already have Git installed (especially if you have a Mac or Linux computer). You can check if you already have Git installed by clicking on the Terminal tab in the Console window in RStudio and typing <code>git --version</code> (the space after the <code>git</code> command is important). If you see something that looks like <code>git version 2.25.0</code> (the version number may be different on your computer) then you already have git installed (happy days). If you get an error (something like <code>git: command not found</code>) this means you don’t have git installed (yet!).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/git_version.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can also do the above outside RStudio by opening up a separate Terminal if you want. On Windows go to the ‘Start menu’ and in the search bar (or run box) type <code>cmd</code> and press enter. On a Mac go to ‘Applications’ in Finder, click on the ‘Utilities’ folder and then on the ‘Terminal’ program. On a Linux machine simply open the Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T often does it).</p>
<p>To install Git on a <strong>windows</strong> computer we recommend you download and install Git for windows (also known as ‘Git Bash’). You can find the download file and installation instructions <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">here</a>.</p>
<p>For those of you using a <strong>Mac</strong> computer we recommend you download Git from <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">here</a> and install in the usual way (double click on the installer package once downloaded). If you’ve previously installed Xcode on your Mac and want to use a more up to date version of Git then you will need to follow a few more steps documented <a href="https://github.com/timcharper/git_osx_installer">here</a>. If you’ve never heard of Xcode then don’t worry about it!</p>
<p>For those of you lucky enough to be working on a <strong>Linux</strong> machine you can simply use your OS package manager to install Git from the official repository. For Ubuntu Linux (or variants of) open your Terminal and type</p>
<p> </p>
<pre class="markup"><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install git</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>You will need administrative privileges to do this. For other versions of Linux see <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/linux">here</a> for further installation instructions.</p>
<p>Whatever version of Git you are installing, once the installation has finished verify that the installation process has been successful by running the command <code>git --version</code> in the Terminal tab in the Console in RStudio (as described above).</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="configure-git" class="section level3">
<h3>Configure Git</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>After installing Git, you need to configure it so you can use it. Click on the Terminal tab in the Console window again and type the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<pre><code>git config --global user.email &#39;you@youremail.com&#39;

git config --global user.name &#39;Your Name&#39;</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>substituting <code>'Your Name'</code> for your actual name and <code>'you@youremail.com'</code> with your email address. We recommend you use your University email address as you will also use this address when you register for your GitHub account (coming up in a bit).</p>
<p>If this was successful, you should see no error messages from these commands. To verify that you have successfully configured Git type the following into the Terminal</p>
<p> </p>
<pre><code>git config --global --list</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>You should see both your <code>user.name</code> and <code>user.email</code> configured.</p>
<p>As you can see above, Git can be used from the command line, but it also integrates well with RStudio, providing a friendly graphical user interface. If you want to use RStudio’s Git integration (we recommend you do - at least at the start), you need to check that the path to the Git executable is specified correctly. In RStudio, go to the menu <code>Tools</code> -&gt; <code>Global Options</code> -&gt; <code>Git/SVN</code> and make sure that ‘Enable version control interface for RStudio projects’ is ticked and that the ‘Git executable:’ path is correct for your installation. If it’s not correct hit the <code>Browse...</code> button and navigate to where you installed git and click on the executable file. You will need to restart RStudio after doing this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/git_path.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="register-a-github-account" class="section level3">
<h3>Register a GitHub account</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If all you want to do is to keep track of files and file versions on your local computer then Git is sufficient. If however, you would like to make an off-site copy of your project or make it available to your collaborators then you will need a web-based hosting service for your Git repositories. This is where GitHub comes into play (there are also other services like <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product">Bitbucket</a> and <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/">Savannah</a>). You can sign up for a free account on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home">here</a>. You will need to specify a username, an email address and a strong password. We suggest that you use your University email address as this will also allow you to apply for a free <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/applying-for-an-educator-or-researcher-discount">educator or researcher account</a> later on which gives you some useful <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/about-github-education-for-educators-and-researchers">benefits</a> (don’t worry about this now though). When it comes to choosing a username we suggest you give this some thought. Choose a short(ish) rather than a long username, use all lowercase and hyphenate if you want to include multiple words, find a way of incorporating your actual name and lastly, choose a username that you will feel comfortable revealing to your future employer!</p>
<p>Next click on the ‘Select a plan’ (you may have to solve a simple puzzle first to verify you’re human) and choose the ‘Free Plan’ option. Github will send an email to the email address you supplied for you to verify.</p>
<p>Once you’ve completed all those steps you should have both Git and GitHub setup up ready for you to use (Finally!).</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="setting-up-a-project-in-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>Setting up a project in RStudio</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Now that you’re all set up, let’s create your first version controlled RStudio project. There are a couple of different approaches you can use to do this. You can either setup a remote GitHub repository first then connect an RStudio project to this (we’ll call this Option 1). Another option is to setup a local repository first and then link a remote GitHub repository to this (Option 2). You can also connect an existing project to a GitHub repository but we won’t cover this here. I would suggest that if you are completely new to Git and GitHub then use Option 1 as this approach sets up your local Git repository nicely and you can <strong>push</strong> and <strong>pull</strong> immediately. Option 2 requires more work (and therefore there are more opportunities to go wrong).</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="option-1---github-first" class="section level3">
<h3>Option 1 - GitHub first</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>To use the GitHub first approach you will first need to create a <strong>repository (repo)</strong> on GitHub. Go to your <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub page</a> and sign in if necessary. Click on the ‘Repositories’ tab at the top and then on the green ‘New’ button on the right</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/new_repo.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Give your new repo a name (let’s call it <code>first_repo</code> for this tutorial), select ‘Public’, tick on the ‘Initialize this repository with a README’ (this is important) and then click on ‘Create repository’ (ignore the other options for now).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/new_repo_opt.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your new GitHub repository will now be created. Notice the README has been rendered in GitHub and is in markdown (.md) format (see the other <a href="Rmarkdown_intro.html">tutorial on R markdown</a> if this doesn’t mean anything to you). Next click on the green ‘Clone or Download’ button and copy the <code>https//...</code> URL that pops up to the clipboard (either highlight it all and copy or click on the clipboard icon to the right).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/new_repo_clone.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ok, we now switch our attention to RStudio. In RStudio click on the <code>File</code> -&gt; <code>New Project</code> menu. In the pop up window select <code>Version Control</code>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/proj_setup1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now paste the the URL you previously copied from GitHub into the <code>Repository URL:</code> box. This should then automatically fill out the <code>Project Directory Name:</code> section with the correct repository name (it’s important that the name of this directory has the same name as the repository you created in GitHub). You can then select where you want to create this directory by clicking on the <code>Browse</code> button opposite the <code>Create project as a subdirectory of:</code> option. Navigate to where you want the directory created and click OK. I also tick the <code>Open in new session</code> option.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/proj_setup2.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>RStudio will now create a new directory with the same name as your repository on your local computer and will then <strong>clone</strong> your remote repository to this directory. The directory will contain three new files; <code>first_repo.Rproj</code> (or whatever you called your repository), <code>README.md</code> and <code>.gitignore</code>. You can check this out in the <code>Files</code> tab usually in the bottom right pane in RStudio. You will also have a <code>Git</code> tab in the top right pane with two files listed (we will come to this later on in the tutorial). That’s it for Option 1, you now have a remote GitHub repository set up and this is linked to your local repository managed by RStudio. Any changes you make to files in this directory will be version controlled by Git.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/proj_setup3.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="option-2---rstudio-first" class="section level3">
<h3>Option 2 - RStudio first</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An alternative approach is to create a local RStudio project first and then create and link to a remote Github repository. As I mentioned above, this option is more involved than Option 1 so feel free to skip this now and come back later to it if you’re interested. However, this option is useful if you just want to create a local RStudio project linked to a local Git repository (i.e. no GitHub involved).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In RStudio click on the <code>File</code> -&gt; <code>New Project</code> menu and select the <code>New Directory</code> option.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/new_proj_RS1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the pop up window select the <code>New Project</code> option</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/proj_setup_RS.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the New Project window specify a <code>Directory name</code> (choose <code>second_repo</code> for this tutorial) and select where you would like to create this directory on you computer (click the <code>Browse</code> button). Make sure the <code>Create a git repository</code> option is ticked</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/new_proj_RS2.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This will create a version controlled directory called <code>second_repo</code> on your computer that contains two files, <code>second_repo.Rproj</code> and <code>.gitignore</code> (there might also be a <code>.Rhistory</code> file but ignore this). You can check this by looking in the <code>Files</code> tab in RStudio (usually in the bottom right pane).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/new_proj_RS3.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>OK, before we go on to create a repository on GitHub we need to do one more thing - we need to place our <code>second_repo.Rproj</code> and <code>.gitignore</code>files under version control. Unfortunately we haven’t covered this in detail yet so just follow the next few instructions (blindly!) and we’ll revisit them in the <a href="#use_git">Using Git</a> section of this tutorial.</p>
<p>To get our two files under version control click on the ‘Git’ tab which is usually in the top tight pane in RStudio</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/new_proj_RS4.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can see that both files are listed. Next, tick the boxes under the ‘Staged’ column for both files and then click on the ‘Commit’ button.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/new_proj_RS5.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This will take you to the Commit window. Type in the commit message ‘First commit’ in the ‘Commit message’ window and click on the ‘Commit’ button. A new window will appear with some messages which you can ignore for now. Click ‘Close’ to close this window and also close the Commit window. The two files should now have disappeared from the Git pane in RStudio indicating a successful commit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/new_proj_RS6.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>OK, that’s those two files now under version control. Now we need to create a new repository on GitHub. In your browser go to your <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub page</a> and sign in if necessary. Click on the green ‘New’ button on the right. Give your new repo the name <code>second_repo</code> (the same as your version controlled directory name) and select ‘Public’. This time <strong>do not</strong> tick the ‘Initialize this repository with a README’ (this is important) and then click on ‘Create repository’.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/new_proj_RS7.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This will take you to a Quick setup page which provides you with some code for various situations. The code we are interested in is the code under <code>...or push an existing repository from the command line</code> heading.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/new_proj_RS8.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Highlight and copy the first line of code (note: yours will be slightly different as it will include your GitHub username not mine)</p>
<p><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/alexd106/second_repo.git</code></p>
<p>Switch to RStudio, click on the ‘Terminal’ tab and paste the command into the Terminal. Now go back to GitHub and copy the second line of code</p>
<p><code>git push -u origin master</code></p>
<p>and paste this into the Terminal in RStudio. You should see something like this</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/new_prog_RS9.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you take a look at your repo back on GitHub (click on the <code>/second_repo</code> link at the top) you will see the <code>second_repo.Rproj</code> and <code>.gitignore</code> files have now been <strong>pushed</strong> to GitHub.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/new_proj_RS10.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The last thing we need to do is create and add a <strong>README</strong> file to your repository. A README file describes your project and is written using the same Markdown language you learned in the R markdown <a href="Rmarkdown_intro.html">tutorial</a>. A good README file makes it easy for others (or the future you!) to use your code and reproduce your project. You can create a README file in RStudio or in GitHub. Let’s use the second option.</p>
<p>In your repository on GitHub click on the green <code>Add a README</code> button.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/new_proj_RS11.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now write a short description of your project in the <code>&lt;&gt; Edit new file</code> section and then click on the green <code>Commit new file</code> button.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/new_proj_RS12.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You should now see the <code>README.md</code> file listed in your repository. It won’t actually exist on your computer yet as you will need to <strong>pull</strong> these changes back to your local repository, but more about that in the next section.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Whether you followed Option 1 or Option 2 (or both) you have now successfully setup a version controlled RStudio project (and associated directory) and linked this to a GitHub repository. Git will now monitor this directory for any changes you make to files and also if you add or delete files. If the steps above seem like a bit of an ordeal, just remember, you only need to do this once for each project and it gets much easier over time.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="use_git" class="section level2">
<h2>Using Git</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Now that we have our project and repositories (both local and remote) set up, it’s finally time to learn how to use Git in RStudio!</p>
<p>Typically, when using Git your workflow will go something like this:</p>
<p> </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You create/delete and edit files in your project directory on your computer as usual (saving these changes as you go)</p></li>
<li><p>Once you’ve reached a natural ‘break point’ in your progress (i.e. you’d be sad if you lost this progress) you <strong>stage</strong> these files</p></li>
<li><p>You then <strong>commit</strong> the changes you made to these staged files (along with a useful commit message) which creates a permanent snapshot of these changes</p></li>
<li><p>You keep on with this cycle until you get to a point when you would like to <strong>push</strong> these changes to GitHub</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re working with other people on the same project you may also need to <strong>pull</strong> their changes to your local computer</p></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/workflow_3.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>OK, let’s go through an example to help clarify this workflow. In RStudio open up the <code>first_repo.Rproj</code> file you created previously during Option 1. Create an R markdown document inside this project by clicking on the <code>File</code> -&gt; <code>New File</code> -&gt; <code>R markdown</code> menu (remember from the R markdown <a href="Rmarkdown_intro.html">tutorial</a>?).</p>
<p>Once created, we can delete all the example R markdown code (except the YAML header) as usual and write some interesting R markdown text and include a plot. We’ll use the inbuilt <code>cars</code> dataset to do this. Save this file (cmd + s for Mac or ctrl + s in Windows). Your R markdown document should look something like the following (it doesn’t matter if it’s not exactly the same).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/first_Rmd.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Take a look at the ‘Git’ tab which should list your new R markdown document (<code>first_doc.Rmd</code> in this example) along with <code>first_repo.Rproj</code>, and <code>.gitignore</code> (you created these files previously when following Option 1).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/first_Rmd2.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Following our workflow, we now need to <strong>stage</strong> these files. To do this tick the boxes under the ‘Staged’ column for all files. Notice that there is a status icon next to the box which gives you an indication of how the files were changed. In our case all of the files are to be added (capital A) as we have just created them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/rstudio_git_cols.png" width="15%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>After you have staged the files the next step is to <strong>commit</strong> the files. This is done by clicking on the ‘Commit’ button.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/first_Rmd3.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>After clicking on the ‘Commit’ button you will be taken to the ‘Review Changes’ window. You should see the three files you staged from the previous step in the left pane. If you click on the file name <code>first_doc.Rmd</code> you will see the changes you have made to this file highlighted in the bottom pane. Content that you have added is highlighted in green and deleted content is highlighted in red. As you have only just created this file, all the content is highlighted in green. To commit these files (take a snapshot) first enter a mandatory commit message in the ‘Commit message’ box. This message should be relatively short and informative (to you and your collaborators) and indicate why you made the changes, not what you changed. This makes sense as Git keeps track of <em>what</em> has changed and so it is best not to use commit messages for this purpose. It’s traditional to enter the message ‘First commit’ (or ‘Initial commit’) when you commit files for the first time. Now click on the ‘Commit’ button to commit these changes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/first_Rmd4.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A summary of the commit you just performed will be shown. Once you’re happy click on the ‘Close’ button to return to the ‘Review Changes’ window. Note that the staged files have now been removed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/first_Rmd5.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now that you have commited your changes the next step is to <strong>push</strong> these changes to GitHub. Before you push your changes it’s good practice to first <strong>pull</strong> any changes from GitHub. This is especially important if you are working with colleagues on the same files as it keeps you local copy up to date and avoids any potential conflicts. In this case your repository will already be up to date but it’s a good habit to get into. To do this, click on the ‘Pull’ button on the top right of the ‘Review Changes’ window. Once you have pulled any changes click on the green ‘Push’ button to push your changes. You will see a summary of the push you just performed. Hit the ‘Close’ button and then close the ‘Review Changes’ window.</p>
<p>  <img src="images/first_Rmd6.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To confirm the changes you made to the project haved been pushed to GitHub, open your GitHub page, click on the Repositories link and then click on the <code>first_repo</code> repository. You should see four files listed including the <code>first_doc.Rmd</code> you just pushed. Along side the file name you will see your last commit message (‘First commit’ in this case) and when you made the last commit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/first_Rmd7.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To see the contents of the file click on the <code>first_doc.Rmd</code> file name.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/first_Rmd8.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<div id="tracking-changes" class="section level3">
<h3>Tracking changes</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>After following the steps outlined above, you will have successfully modified an RStudio project by creating a new R markdown document, staged and then commited these changes and finally pushed the changes to your GitHub repository. Now let’s make some further changes to your R markdown file and follow the workflow once again but this time we ’ll take a look at how to identify changes made to files, examine the commit history and how to restore to a previous version of the document.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In RStudio open up the <code>first_repo.Rproj</code> file you created previously (if not already open) then open the <code>first_doc.Rmd</code> file (click on the file name in the <code>Files</code> tab in RStudio).</p>
<p>Let’s make some changes to this document. Delete the line begining with ‘My first version controlled …’ and replace it with something more informative (see figure below). We will also change the plotted symbols to red and give the plot axes labels. Lastly, let’s add a summary of the dataframe using the <code>summary()</code> function and let’s render this document to pdf.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/mod1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now click the <code>knit</code> button and render to pdf. A new pdf file named <code>first_doc.pdf</code> will be created which you can view by clicking on the file name in the <code>Files</code> tab in RStudio.</p>
<p>Notice that these two files have been added to the <code>Git</code> tab in RStudio. The status icons indicate that the <code>first_doc.Rmd</code> file has been modified (capital M) and the <code>first_doc.pdf</code> file is currently untracked (question mark).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/mod2.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To stage these files tick the ‘Staged’ box for each file and click on the ‘Commit’ button to take you to the ‘Review Changes’ window</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/mod3.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before you commit your changes notice the status of <code>first_doc.pdf</code> has changed from untracked to added (A). You can also view the changes you have made to the <code>first_doc.Rmd</code> by clicking on the file name in the top left pane which will then provide you with a useful summary of the changes in the bottom pane. Lines that have been deleted are highlighted in red and lines that have been added are highlighted in green (note that from Git’s point of view, a modification to a line is actually two operations: the removal of the original line followed by the creation of a new line). Once you’re happy, commit these changes by writing a suitable commit message and click on the ‘Commit’ button.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/mod4.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To push the changes to GitHub, click on the ‘Pull’ button first (remember this is good practice even though you are only collaborating with yourself at the moment) and then click on the ‘Push’ button. Go to your online GitHub repository and you will see your new commits, including the <code>first_doc.pdf</code> file you created when you rendered your R markdown document.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="images/mod5.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To view the changes in <code>first_doc.Rmd</code> click on the file name for this file.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>This is also possible in RStudio. Click on “Diff” or “Commit”. Select a file with changes you do not want. Use “Discard All” to discard all changes in that file. Use “Discard chunk” to discard changes in that file, selectively. Repeat this procedure for each affected file until you are back to an acceptable state. Carry on.</p>

</div>
<div id="revert-to-a-previous-commit" class="section level4">
<h4>Revert to a previous commit</h4>
<p>Oops, I broke it! One of the great things about a version control system is that if you break your code you can always go back to when it was still working. There are two ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If you have made a mistake or you forgot to include a file in your last commit, which you have not yet pushed to your remote repository, then you can just make your changes, use <code>git add</code> to stage the new or the changed file and then use the command <code>git commit --amend</code>. This will change your previous commit to include the new changes. You can also use this command on its own if you just want to modify the commit message.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are already a few commits away from the one that broke your code and you need to go back to a previous version of your project, first use <code>git reflog</code>, which will show you a list of everything you have done in git. Then, find the step that broke your code. Finally use <code>git reset</code> and the step’s index (something of the form <code>HEAD@{index}</code>, which you’ll find in the output of <code>git reflog</code>) to revert to that point in time. Seems like magic, but it has limitations. <code>git reset</code> can create problems if you have already pushed changes to the remote repository, so only use it in this way if you want to go back a series of commits that you have not pushed yet.</p></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="collaborate" class="section level4">
<h4>Collaborate</h4>
<p>GitHub is a great tool for collaboration, it can seem scary and complicated at first, but it is worth investing some time to learn how it works. What makes it so good for collaboration is that it is a <em>distributed system</em>, which means that every collaborator works on their own copy of the project and changes are then merged together in the remote repository. There are two different ways you can set up a collaborative project on GitHub. One is the workflow we just went through, where everybody connects their local repository to the same remote one; this system works well with small project where different people mainly work on different aspects of the project. The second approach consists of every collaborator creating a copy (or <em>fork</em>) of the main repository, which becomes their remote repository. Every collaborator then needs to send a request (a <em>pull request</em>) to the owner of the main repository to incorporate any changes into the main repository and this includes a review process before the changes are integrated.</p>
<p>Git offers a number of advanced features that you can incorporate in your workflow. If you are going to be working on a large collaborative project it is worth looking into <em>forking</em>, <em>branching</em> and <em>pull requests</em>. If you are the only person working on your code, then the workflow detailed here is usually enough.</p>
