## Sampling and data description

These data were originally collected as part of a study published in Aquatic Living Resources (Smith *et al*., 2005). The aim of the study was to investigate the seasonal patterns of investment in somatic and reproductive tissues in the long finned squid *Loligo forbesi* caught in Scottish waters. Squid were caught monthly from December 1989 - July 1991 (**month** and **year variables**). After capture, each squid was given a unique specimen code (**specimen variable**) and the following variables measured: 

\  

- **weight variable** - body weight (g)
- **sex variable** - sex (only female squid are included here)
- **DML variable** - individual dorsal mantle length (mm)
- **eviscerate.weight variable** - mantle weight measured without internal organs (g)
- **ovary.weight variable** - gonad weight (g) 
- **nid.weight variable** - nidamental gland weight (g)
- **nid.length variable** - nidamental gland length (g)  
- **dig.weight variable** -  digestive gland weight (g)

\  

Each individual was also assigned a categorical measure of maturity (**maturity.stage variable**) ranging from 1 to 5 with 1 = immature, 5 = mature.  

Some interesting background information on squid morphology can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loligo_forbesii) and the following image provides a useful summary of squid anatomy.

## Data import and exploration

```{r, data-import}
squid <- read.table('./data/squid1.txt', header = TRUE)
str(squid)
```

In this dataset `r nrow(squid)`  squid were caught and `r ncol(squid)` variables were measured. Details are shown above.  

\  

```{r, data-recode, echo=FALSE}
# convert variables to factors
squid$Fmaturity <- factor(squid$maturity.stage)
squid$Fmonth <- factor(squid$month) 
squid$Fyear <- factor(squid$year)
```

\  

The variables `maturity.stage`, `month` and `year` were converted from integers to factors in the dataframe  `squid`. These recoded variables were named `Fmaturity`, `Fmonth` and `Fyear`.  

```{r, data-obs}
library(knitr)
kable(table(squid$Fmonth, squid$Fyear), row.names = TRUE, format = 'markdown')
```

\  

In 1989 data were only collected during December and in 1991 data collection stopped in August. During 1990, no data were collected in either February or June. There are also some months that have very few observations (May 1990 and July 1991 for example) so care must be taken when modelling these data.

\  

```{r, maturity-obs, echo=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)

kable(table(squid$Fmaturity, squid$Fmonth), row.names = TRUE) %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 10)
```

\  

Not all maturity stages were observed in all months. Very few squid of maturity stage 1, 2 or 3 were caught in the months February to May whereas maturity stages 4 and 5 were predominantly caught during these months.

\  

Now let's check for any unusual observations in the variables; ```DML```, ```weight```, ```nid.length``` and ```ovary.weight```. 

\  

```{r, dotplot}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
    dotchart(squid$DML, main = "DML")
    dotchart(squid$weight, main = "weight")
    dotchart(squid$nid.length, main = "nid length")
    dotchart(squid$ovary.weight, main = "ovary weight")
```

\  

It looks like the variable `nid.length` contains an **unusually large** value. Actually, this value is biologically implausible and clearly an error. I went back and checked my field notebook and sure enough it's a typo. I was knackered at the time and accidentally inserted a zero by mistake when transcribing these data. **Doh!** This squid was subsequently removed from the data set.

## Session Information

```{r, session-info, echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```
