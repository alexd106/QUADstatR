  Dear all R course attendees,
   
  Just thought I would drop you all a quick email to remind you that your Introduction to R course will start tomorrow at 09:30. We'll meet virtually in the main Blackboard Collaborate course room which you can find by following the Blackboard collaborate link on the MyAberdeen course site (https://abdn.blackboard.com/).
   
  A couple of things you will need to do before tomorrow:
   
  1. Make sure that you can access MyAberdeen. If you find you are having any difficulties, please email Izzie (quadrat@abdn.ac.uk) and myself as soon as possible.
   
  2. Install R and RStudio on the computer you will be using during the course. Full instructions (including a video) can be found at this link https://alexd106.github.io/QUADstatR/setup.html If you already have R and RStudio installed please update to the latest versions.
   
  If you are having trouble installing R and/or RStudio I will run an optional drop-in session in the main meeting room on blackboard collaborate (https://abdn.blackboard.com/) today at 14:00 - 15:00. Feel free to join this session if you would like some help or wanted to ask any questions about the course.
   
  Well, that's about it. I look forward to meeting you all tomorrow.
   
  Cheers
  Alex
